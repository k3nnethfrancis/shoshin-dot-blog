                    <p>Maybe its not falsifiable, but I can't shake the feeling that everything's connected.</p>
<p>Maybe I achieved nirvana.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's because every once in a while the poignant scent of evidence smacks my nose like a jar of smelling salts.</p>
<p>From the chaining nature of events culminating in the butterfly effect to the substantial evidence that all life stems from a single root. The biosphere intertwines life such that the extinction of a single species of bee could cause global human population collapse.</p>
<p>One could argue a similar sphere exists connecting humanity itself...</p>
<p>A single lived experience – even just a moment – can shape a person for a lifetime. A shared social experience can shape a culture for a century.</p>
<p>These days, it's as if we're all dipping into the same memetic pool. We're at a point in history when information is more abundant than ever. The internet enables shared experiences on a global scale, bringing us together at a rate we fail to appreciate.</p>
<p>As a 90s kid working in tech, I'm deeply entrenched in these ideas. I've watched the internet develop from the Kid Goku days of screeching dial-up to Super Saiyan web3 on virtual reality, blockchain, and artificial intelligence.</p>

For people like me, the internet is culture.</p>
<p>I believe we are witnessing the next phase of human evolution towards the noosphere.</p>
<p>DAOs are the next phase of evolution towards the noosphere</p>
<p>— k3nn.eth (@k3nnethfrancis) February 4, 2022
The 'noosphere' is an idea popularized by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin with his book, The Phenomenon of Man. It describes a product of evolution where human consciousness reflects an increasingly connected hive mind – a sort of thought biosphere.</p>
<p>I find the noosphere interesting because it represents the stage of evolution where consciousness as we know it is no longer a singular phenomenon. One of Teilhard's points, however, is that it never really was.</p>
<p>From atoms and molecules to the necessary configurations required for life – at what point in the evolutionary process does consciousness emerge?</p>
<p>In some ways, this is the Sorites paradox applied to the evolution of mind.</p>
<p>In Teilhard's view, consciousness is the product of evolution's increasing complexity. And through science and technology, humanity becomes capable of collective knowledge and organization on a global scale. This capability [as was the result of cellular complexity leading to conscious humans] is what catalyzes the emergence of the noosphere.</p>
<p>For a book written almost a century ago, Teilhard's views feel remarkably familiar to what is happening with the internet today.</p>
<p>At the edge of the web3 revolution, new methods of human coordination have emerged. At the same time, DeSci builds the scientific hyperstructures of the future.</p>
<p>We may still be early on in this chapter of the human story, but I am personally convinced that this is the technology Teilhard prophesied.</p>
<p>DAOs represent the next phase of human evolution towards the noosphere.</p>
